Start of versioning docs for this package.

7/23/13
    - fixed output of 'sampleKeyGen.pl'.  Output was putting \t at the end of the lines of the final
      output file.  

8/15/13 - v0.8.0
    - Added ability to choose different default lookup table for the cpscChecker function with the '-l' 
      option.
    - Added a here doc description of the program and usage to help show how to use the program.

8/30/13 - v8.8.1
    - Added a new lookup in cpscChecker.pl that would use the lookup table to assign a variant call a cosmic
      id in the event the TVC did not issue one (due to the variant not being in the HotSpots BED file).  
    - Fixed the lookup tables to have the variant start position agree with what TVC reports.  This will help
      some downstream analysis packages I've been working on.

9/3/13 - v8.8.2
    - Cleaned up the lookup tables and changed some of the start positions of the variants in the table to 
      match the output of TVC.  This will help in scripting later on.
